### About the Project
C-shell implements a simple Unix shell program. The shell can execute simple commands with I/O redirection and will expand ~ to the userâ€™s home directory. Only the cd and exit built-in commands are supported.

This project was a great exercise in understanding the workings of operating systems, particularly Unix-based operating systems.
